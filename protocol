This is an outline of the different scripts, their function, and the order they
are run in to produce the final data

1) Get raw hg38 data to determine Alu positions using repeat masker. hg38
includes alt and unknown/unplaced chromosomes (listed as chr#_ID_alt). 

> scripts/get_raw_hg38_repeats.sh

output: hg38.fa.* set of files

To Do: 
modify script to only download required files (hg38.fa.out?) instead of full set
modify script to set location/filenames on download

2) Filter for hg38 repeats for Alu elements, their chromosome and position, 
name, strand, and overlap positions with consensus sequence.

> scripts/get_alu_data.sh hg38.fa.out

output: alu_positions.tab, tabular file with the above data, and headers

To Do:
modify script to allow piping output into next command/naming of output file - Done
double check header names for consistency with RepeatMasker output format - Done
modify script to use tr instead of complicated sed command for whitespace? - No
get rid of tail -n+4? - Done
modify script to allow output of different types of repeats? - Done, can filter for arbitrary pattern

3) get raw snps data from ?

> ? 

output: allsnps, list of all *common* snps in human genome, including chrom,
start and end position, name, strand, reference NCBI and UCSC base at that
position, observed polymorphism, change type, and type of gene/position it
occurs in (i.e. intron, ncRNA, etc)

To Do:
determine source of data
write script to get? May be hard, was browser based bc UCSC browser stupidity

4) extract important SNP data

> ? - some sed command

output: allsnspmodified, tab file with chrom, start and end position, name,
strand, reference base, modification, and class of polymorphism (single,
insertion, deletion, etc)

To Do:
determine sed command
modify to only collect genomic singles, or to split genomic singles/indels, etc
into multiple files for different analysis?

5) Install Bioconductor/Genomic Ranges
> R
> source('https://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R')
> biocLite('Genomic Ranges')
6) create genomic ranges in R for determining overlaps

> R
> source('create_snp_ranges.R')

output: set of genomic ranges for ALU elements (all, positive strand, and 
negative strand), and for SNPs in R.

To Do:
Verify postive strand/negative strand necessary
   determine there is an easier way to split
check if strand from SNPs is causing issue for determining overlaps in opposite
strand alu elements
modify script to allow calling file names of SNPs/Alu element location files 
modify GRanges to hold more additional info
   consensus overlap info?
   repeat type
   SNP "type"
